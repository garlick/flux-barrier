NAME
----
flux-xbarrier - test driver for xbarrier module


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux-xbarier* ['--nprocs N'] [--test-iterations N'] 'name'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-xbarrier(1) sets up a barrier with the 'xbarrier' module.
'N' tasks are expected to enter the barrier, thus 'N' instances
of *flux-xbarrier* should be started with identical arguments.
The command blocks until the barrier is entered by all tasks.

The 'name' of the barrier must be unique across the comms session.

OPTIONS
-------
*-n, --nprocs*='N'::
Set the number of tasks that must enter the barrier before it will exit.

*-t, --test-iterations*='N'::
Run 'N' iterations of the barrier as a test.
